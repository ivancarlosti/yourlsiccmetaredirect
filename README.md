## Inspiration
* Project inspired by [yourls-meta-redirect](https://github.com/pureexe/yourls-meta-redirect), license preserved.

## Instructions
* Download the plugin release
* Create the folder `icc-meta-redirect` into YOURLS path `/user/plugins` and store `plugin.php` on it
* Activate plugin in `/admin/plugins.php` page of your YOURLS installation
* (optional) Access `Meta Redirect` page
* (optional) Manage settings and save
* You can now use your character to make a meta redirect instead of server redirect, example: [icc.gg/.signal](https://icc.gg/.signal)

## Requirements
* YOURLS 1.10+
